# Build log — Aegis-Edge 3D (overnight self-extending loop)

Newest at the bottom. One line per iteration: date/time, task, how verified.

- 2026-06-29 23:0x CDT — Seed built by Chopper. Vite + TS + three.js app that BUILDS and runs:
  terrain + procedural city + protected asset + no-fly dome, 3 sensor sites w/ coverage volumes,
  4 drones flying smooth spline paths with spinning rotors + trails, threat coloring from the
  deterministic `model/threatCall` classifier, click-a-track → explainable threat-call panel
  (offline template). Synthetic scenario incl. hostile track 0427. Verified: `npm run typecheck`
  + `npm run build` green. Spec (requirements + tasks T1–T10) + loop playbook in place. Loop armed.
