# Build log — Aegis-Edge 3D (overnight self-extending loop)

Newest at the bottom. One line per iteration: date/time, task, how verified.

- 2026-06-29 23:0x CDT — Seed built by Chopper. Vite + TS + three.js app that BUILDS and runs:
  terrain + procedural city + protected asset + no-fly dome, 3 sensor sites w/ coverage volumes,
  4 drones flying smooth spline paths with spinning rotors + trails, threat coloring from the
  deterministic `model/threatCall` classifier, click-a-track → explainable threat-call panel
  (offline template). Synthetic scenario incl. hostile track 0427. Verified: `npm run typecheck`
  + `npm run build` green. Spec (requirements + tasks T1–T10) + loop playbook in place. Loop armed.
- 2026-06-29 23:31 CDT — T1 done (Chopper). Replaced the flat box drone with a real quadrotor:
  capsule hull (forward axis), carbon X-frame arms + motor pods, blurred contra-rotors (blur disc +
  two thin blades), a nose-slung camera gimbal w/ lens, and nav lights (port red / starboard green /
  blinking white tail strobe). Added bank-into-turn — the airframe rolls into the signed heading
  change (eased, clamped ±0.6 rad) via an inner `frame` group, while the outer group yaws via lookAt.
  Per-drone rotor spin + strobe blink in the loop. Classifier untouched. Verified: `npm run typecheck`
  + `npm run build` both green (dist 522 kB).
- 2026-06-29 23:55 CDT — T2 done (Chopper). City & terrain pass so the scene reads as a real dusk
  skyline, not a void. Added a gradient sky dome (warm horizon → deep-blue zenith via a BackSide
  ShaderMaterial, fog-off so it stays visible past the fog far). Buildings rebuilt as groups with
  procedural dusk facades: a pool of 6 emissive window canvas-textures scattered warm/cool, cloned
  per building with repeat scaled to footprint/height, over 5 varied concrete facade tones. Each
  building now has a closed roof slab + parapet rim (no more open box tops) plus deterministic
  rooftop equipment — HVAC blocks / water tank / comms mast w/ red obstruction beacon. Ground gets a
  subtle procedural speckle texture (repeat 28×) instead of flat color; fog tint warmed to dusk.
  All variety is position-seeded so it's identical every run. Classifier untouched. Verified:
  `npm run typecheck` + `npm run build` both green (dist 525.63 kB).
